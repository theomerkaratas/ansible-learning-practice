# Chapter 1 - Basic Ansible Configuration

This chapter contains the initial Ansible setup.  
No playbooks were written here - the focus is only on **configuration and running ad-hoc commands**.

- **ansible.cfg** -> Defines the inventory location and basic Ansible settings.  
- **inventory** -> Lists the managed host(s) with SSH connection details (host, user, private key, and Python interpreter).  

Goal:  
Learn how to connect to a remote server and run **ad-hoc Ansible commands** without using playbooks yet.
